    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
    By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
	By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
	find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    NestWhileList[] generates a list of pairs of adjacent Fibonacci numbers
    Each pair is in the form {current Fibonacci number, next Fibonacci number}
    The condition #[[2]] < 4*10^6 ensures the process continues while the second element of most recently generated
    pair is less than 4 million

    [[All, 1]] extracts the first element from each pair, creating the list of Fibonacci numbers
    Select[] filters this list to include only the even numbers
    Total[] computes the sum of these even Fibonacci numbers

Total[Select[NestWhileList[{#[[2]], #[[1]] + #[[2]]} &, {1,2}, #[[2]] < 4*10^6 &][[All, 1]], EvenQ]]
