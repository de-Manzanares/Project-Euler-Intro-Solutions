# Project-Euler-Solutions

### About 

This project aims to be a collection of my best attempts at solving the
first 100 problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Whenever
possible I like to generalize the code a bit. Thus, some solutions may not be
fully optimized. However, they are prepared to handle a wider range of
parameters.

I've done my best to make the code easily readable. Each solution has its own
file and is named after the problem number.
